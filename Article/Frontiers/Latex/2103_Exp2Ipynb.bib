abstract = {Discovering DNA regulatory sequence motifs and their relative positions are vital to understand the mechanisms of gene expression regulation. Such complicated motif grammars are difficult to be summarized from shallow models. Although Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) achieved great success in annotating cis-regulatory elements, few combinatorial motif grammars have been accurately interpreted due to the mixed signal in DCNN. To address this problem, we proposed NeuronMotif, a general backward decoupling algorithm, to reveal the homo-/hetero-typic motif combinations and arrangements embedded in convolutional neurons. We applied NeuronMotif on several widely-used DCNN models. Many uncovered motif grammars of deep convolutional neurons are supported by literature or ATAC-seq footprinting. We further diagnosed the sick neurons that are sensitive to adversarial noises, which can guide DCNN architecture optimization for better prediction performance and motif feature extraction. Overall, NeuronMotif enables decoding cis-regulatory codes from deep convolutional neurons and understanding DCNN from a novel perspective.},

abstract = {Promoters play a key role in influencing transcriptional regulation for fine-tuning expression of genes. Heterologous promoter engineering has been a widely used concept to control the level of transcription in all model organisms. The strength of a promoter is mainly determined by its nucleotide composition. Many promoter libraries have been curated but few have attempted to develop theoretical methods to predict the strength of promoters from its nucleotide sequence. Such theoretical methods are not only valuable in the design of promoters with specified strength, but are also meaningful to understand the mechanism of promoters in gene transcription. In this study, we present a theoretical model to describe the relationship between promoter strength and nucleotide sequence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We infer from our analysis that the-49 to 10 sequence with respect to the Transcription Start Site represents the minimal region that can be used to predict the promoter strength.

abstract = {Background: Production of recombinant proteins in bacteria for academic and commercial purposes is a well established field; however the outcomes of process developments for specific proteins are still often unpredictable. One reason is the limited understanding of the performance of expression cassettes relative to each other due to different genetic contexts. Here we report the results of a systematic study aiming at exclusively comparing commonly used regulator/promoter systems by standardizing the designs of the replicon backbones.Results: The vectors used in this study are based on either the RK2- or the pMB1- origin of replication and contain the regulator/promoter regions of XylS/Pm (wild-type), XylS/Pm ML1-17 (a Pm variant), LacI/PT7lac, LacI/Ptrc and AraC/PBAD to control expression of different proteins with various origins. Generally and not unexpected high expression levels correlate with high replicon copy number and the LacI/PT7lac system generates more transcript than all the four other cassettes. However, this transcriptional feature does not always lead to a correspondingly more efficient protein production, particularly if protein functionality is considered. In most cases the XylS/Pm ML1-17 and LacI/PT7lac systems gave rise to the highest amounts of functional protein production, and the XylS/Pm ML1-17 is the most flexible in the sense that it does not require any specific features of the host. The AraC/PBAD system is very good with respect to tightness, and a commonly used bioinformatics prediction tool (RBS calculator) suggested that it has the most translation-efficient UTR. Expression was also studied by flow cytometry in individual cells, and the results indicate that cell to cell heterogeneity is very relevant for understanding protein production at the population level.Conclusions: The choice of expression system needs to be evaluated for each specific case, but we believe that the standardized vectors developed for this study can be used to more easily identify the nature of case-specific bottlenecks. By then taking into account the relevant characteristics of each expression cassette it will be easier to make the best choice with respect to the goal of achieving high levels of protein expression in functional or non-functional form. {\textcopyright} 2013 Balzer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} A transcription factor (TF) is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that modulates the transcription of a set of particular genes, and thus regulates gene expression in the cell. TFs have commonly been predicted by analyzing sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of TFs already characterized. Thus, TFs that do not show homologies with the reported ones are difficult to predict. Here we report the development of a deep learning-based tool, DeepTFactor, that predicts whether a protein in question is a TF.

Here, we applied a synthetic biology, learn-by-design approach to elucidate the sequence and structural determinants that control mRNA stability in bacterial operons. We designed, constructed, and characterized 82 operons in Escherichia coli, systematically varying RNase binding site characteristics, translation initiation rates, and transcriptional terminator efficiencies in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), intergenic, and 3′ UTR regions, followed by measuring their mRNA levels using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays during exponential growth. We show that introducing long single-stranded RNA into 5′ UTRs reduced mRNA levels by up to 9.4-fold and that lowering translation rates reduced mRNA levels by up to 11.8-fold. We also found that RNase binding sites in intergenic regions had much lower effects on mRNA levels. Surprisingly, changing the transcriptional termination efficiency or introducing long single-stranded RNA into 3′ UTRs had no effect on upstream mRNA levels. From these measurements, we developed and validated biophysical models of ribosome protection and RNase activity with excellent quantitative agreement. We also formulated design rules to rationally control a mRNA's stability, facilitating the automated design of engineered genetic systems with desired functionalities.},

abstract = {Well-characterized promoter collections for synthetic biology applications are not always available in industrially relevant hosts. We developed a broadly applicable method for promoter identification in atypical microbial hosts that requires no a priori understanding of cis-regulatory element structure. This novel approach combines bioinformatic filtering with rapid empirical characterization to expand the promoter toolkit and uses machine learning to improve the understanding of the relationship between DNA sequence and function. Here, we apply the method in Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius, a thermophilic organism with high potential as a synthetic biology chassis for industrial applications. Bioinformatic screening of G. kaustophilus, G. stearothermophilus, G. thermodenitrificans, and G. thermoglucosidasius resulted in the identification of 636 100 bp putative promoters, encompassing the genome-wide design space and lacking known transcription factor binding sites. Eighty of these sequences were characterized in vivo, and activities covered a 2-log range of predictable expression levels. Seven sequences were shown to function consistently regardless of the downstream coding sequence. Partition modeling identified sequence positions upstream of the canonical −35 and −10 consensus motifs that were predicted to strongly influence regulatory activity in Geobacillus, and artificial neural network and partial least squares regression models were derived to assess if there were a simple, forward, quantitative method for in silico prediction of promoter function. However, the models were insufficiently general to predict pre hoc promoter activity in vivo, most probably as a result of the relatively small size of the training data set compared to the size of the modeled design space.},

abstract = {Transcription networks consist of hundreds of transcription factors with thousands of often overlapping target genes. While we can reliably measure gene expression changes, we still understand relatively little why expression changes the way it does. How does a coordinated response emerge in such complex networks and how many input signals are necessary to achieve it? Here, we unravel the regulatory program of gene expression in Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism with more than 30 known transcription factors. Using a library of fluorescent transcriptional reporters, we comprehensively quantify the activity of central metabolic promoters in 26 environmental conditions. The expression patterns were dominated by growth rate-dependent global regulation for most central metabolic promoters in concert with highly condition-specific activation for only few promoters. Using an approximate mathematical description of promoter activity, we dissect the contribution of global and specific transcriptional regulation. About 70{\%} of the total variance in promoter activity across conditions was explained by global transcriptional regulation. Correlating the remaining specific transcriptional regulation of each promoter with the cell's metabolome response across the same conditions identified potential regulatory metabolites. Remarkably, cyclic AMP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and fructose-1-phosphate alone explained most of the specific transcriptional regulation through their interaction with the two major transcription factors Crp and Cra. Thus, a surprisingly simple regulatory program that relies on global transcriptional regulation and input from few intracellular metabolites appears to be sufficient to coordinate E. coli central metabolism and explain about 90{\%} of the experimentally observed transcription changes in 100 genes.},

The relation between the input signal level and the expression of the gene is called the gene regulation function. It is of interest to understand the shape of a gene regulation function in terms of the environment in which it has evolved and the basic constraints of biological systems. Here we address this by presenting a cost–benefit theory for gene regulation functions that takes into account temporally varying inputs in the environment and stochastic noise in the biological components. We apply this theory to the well-studied lac operon of E. coli. The present theory explains the shape of this regulation function in terms of temporal variation of the input signals, and of minimizing the deleterious effect of cell–cell variability in regulatory protein levels. We also apply the theory to understand the evolutionary tradeoffs in setting the number of regulatory proteins and for selection of feed-forward loops in genetic circuits. The present cost–benefit theory can be used to understand the shape of other gene regulatory functions in terms of environment and noise constraints.},

The difficulty in finding patterns in tiny sequences is the main reason that makes small ORFs to be overlooked by computational procedures. However, advances in experimental methods show that small proteins can play vital roles in cellular activities. Hence, it is urgent to make progress in the development of computational approaches to speed up the identification of potential small ORFs. In this work, our focus is on bacterial genomes. We improve a previous approach to identify small ORFs in bacteria. Our method uses machine learning techniques and decoy subject sequences to filter out spurious ORF alignments. We show that an advanced multivariate analysis can be more effective in terms of sensitivity than applying the simplistic and widely used e-value cutoff. This is particularly important in the case of small ORFs for which alignments present higher e-values than usual. Experiments with control datasets show that the machine learning algorithms used in our method to curate significant alignments can achieve average sensitivity and specificity of 97.06{\%} and 99.61{\%}, respectively. Therefore, an important step is provided here toward the construction of more accurate computational tools for the identification of small ORFs in bacteria.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {For control analysis, it is necessary to modulate the activity of an enzyme around its normal level and measure the changes in steady‐state fluxes or concentrations. We describe an improved method for effecting the modulation, as elaborated for Escherichia coli. The chromosomal gene, encoding the enzyme of interest, is put under the control of a lacUV5 or a tacI promoter. The alternative use of the two promoters leads to an expression range which should make it suitable for the use in control analysis of many enzymes. The lacUV5 promoter should be used when the wild‐type expression level is low, the tacI promoter when the latter is high. The endogenous lac operon is placed under the control of a second copy of the lacUV5 promoter and a lac Yam mutation (eliminating lactose permease, the transport system for the inducer isopropyl‐thio‐$\beta$‐D‐galactoside) is introduced. The method was demonstrated experimentally by constructing E. coli strains, in which the chromosomal atp operon is transcribed from the lacUV5 and the tacI promoter. We measured the concentration of the c subunit of H+‐ATPase, and found that the expression of this enzyme could be modulated between non‐detectable levels and up to five times the wild‐type level. Thus, in the absence of inducer, no expression of atp genes could be detected when the atp operon was controlled by the lacUV5 promoter, and we estimate that the expression was less than 0.0025 times the wild‐type level. We show that the introduction of a lac Y mutation facilitated the attainment of steady induction levels of partially induced cells. The mutation also reduced positive cooperativity in the dependence of expression on the concentration of isopropyl‐thio‐$\beta$‐D‐galactoside (the inducer) and shifted the concentration of inducer needed for half maximum induction to higher values. These properties should facilitate the experimental modulation of the enzyme activity by varying the concentration of the inducer. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Gene function is typically evaluated by sampling the continuum of gene expression at only a few discrete points corresponding to gene knockout or overexpression. We argue that this characterization is incomplete and present a library of engineered promoters of varying strengths obtained through mutagenesis of a constitutive promoter. A multifaceted characterization of the library, especially at the single-cell level to ensure homogeneity, permitted quantitative assessment correlating the effect of gene expression levels to improved growth and product formation phenotypes in Escherichia coli. Integration of these promoters into the chromosome can allow for a quantitative accurate assessment of genetic control. To this end, we used the characterized library of promoters to assess the impact of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase levels on growth yield and deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels on lycopene production. The multifaceted characterization of promoter strength enabled identification of optimal expression levels for ppc and dxs, which maximized the desired phenotype. Additionally, in a strain preengineered to produce lycopene, the response to deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels was linear at all levels tested, indicative of a rate-limiting step, unlike the parental strain, which exhibited an optimum expression level, illustrating that optimal gene expression levels are variable and dependent on the genetic background of the strain. This promoter library concept is illustrated as being generalizable to eukaryotic organisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and thus constitutes an integral platform for functional genomics, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering endeavors. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

@article{Le2020,
abstract = {Motivation

Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems are helpful data science assistants designed to scan data for novel features, select appropriate supervised learning models and optimize their parameters. For this purpose, Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was developed using strongly typed genetic programing (GP) to recommend an optimized analysis pipeline for the data scientist's prediction problem. However, like other AutoML systems, TPOT may reach computational resource limits when working on big data such as whole-genome expression data.
Results

We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the system's scalability: Feature Set Selector (FSS) and Template. FSS provides the option to specify subsets of the features as separate datasets, assuming the signals come from one or more of these specific data subsets. FSS increases TPOT's efficiency in application on big data by slicing the entire dataset into smaller sets of features and allowing GP to select the best subset in the final pipeline. Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed GP and enables the incorporation of FSS at the beginning of each pipeline. Consequently, FSS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and may provide more interpretable results. Our simulations show TPOT-FSS significantly outperforms a tuned XGBoost model and standard TPOT implementation. We apply TPOT-FSS to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder. Independent of the previous study that identified significant association with depression severity of two modules, TPOT-FSS corroborates that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual.

Detailed simulation and analysis code needed to reproduce the results in this study is available at https://github.com/lelaboratoire/tpot-fss. Implementation of the new TPOT operators is available at https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot.},

To investigate how, we engineered a synthetic library of 154 genes that varied randomly at synonymous sites, but all encoded the same green fluorescent protein (GFP). When expressed in Escherichia coli, GFP protein levels varied 250-fold across the library. GFP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, mRNA degradation patterns, and bacterial growth rates also varied, but codon bias did not correlate with gene expression. Rather, the stability of mRNA folding near the ribosomal binding site explained more than half the variation in protein levels. In our analysis, mRNA folding and associated rates of translation initiation play a predominant role in shaping expression levels of individual genes, whereas codon bias influences global translation efficiency and cellular fitness.},

In this critical review, we used hypothetical reverse mutations to evaluate the performance of five representative algorithms and found all of them suffer from the problem of overfitting. This approach is based on the fact that if a wild-type protein is more stable than a mutant protein, then the same mutant is less stable than the wild-type protein. We analyzed the underlying issues and suggest that the main causes of the overfitting problem include that the numbers of training cases were too small, and the features used in the models were not sufficiently informative for the task.

We precisely designed 244,000 DNA sequences implementing 56 replicates of a full factorial design to evaluate nucleotide, secondary structure, codon and amino acid properties in combination. For each sequence, we measured reporter transcript abundance and decay, polysome profiles, protein production and growth rates. Associations between designed sequences properties and these consequent phenotypes were dominated by secondary structures and their interactions within transcripts. We confirmed that transcript structure generally limits translation initiation and demonstrated its physiological cost using an epigenetic assay. Codon composition has a sizable impact on translatability, but only in comparatively rare elongation-limited transcripts. We propose a set of design principles to improve translation efficiency that would benefit from more accurate prediction of secondary structures in vivo.},

However, genomic context, gene copy number, and transcription/translation interplay often introduce considerable uncertainty to the design of reliable genetic constructs. In this work, we have established a standardized heterologous expression device in which the promoter strength is the only variable; the remaining parameters of the flow have stable default values. To this end, we tailored a mini-Tn7 delivery transposon vector that inserts the constructs in a single genomic locus of P. putida's chromosome. This was then merged with a promoter insertion site, an unvarying translational coupler, and a downstream location for placing the gene(s) of interest under fixed assembly rules. This arrangement was exploited to benchmark a collection of synthetic promoters with low transcriptional noise in this bacterial host. Growth experiments and flow cytometry with single-copy promoter–GFP constructs revealed a robust, constitutive behavior of these promoters, whose strengths and properties could be faithfully compared. This standardized expression device significantly extends the repertoire of tools available for reliable metabolic engineering and other genetic enhancements of P. putida.},

To achieve this, we assayed the expression of a comprehensive library of transcriptional reporter strains under different conditions. High-temporal resolution measurements of promoter activities were obtained for different growth rates spanning recovery from stationary phase into exponential phase and eventually deep stationary phase again. We find that the genome-wide promoter activity follows a power-law distribution, which depends solely on growth rate and is independent of the specific growth conditions. Moreover, we find that the power-law distribution can be decomposed into two log-normal distributions: metabolic promoters that make up the low end of the distribution, and ribosomal promoters that make up the high end of the distribution. While distributions remained constant for a given growth rate, the ranked expression of metabolic promoters differed according to the specific condition. Thus, the invariant distribution may suggest optimal resource allocation under constrained resources. A mathematical theory is presented to explain these results.},

UP-element contribution, best described by the length and frequency of A- and T-tracts, in combination with a PWM-based core promoter model, accurately predicted promoter strength both in vivo and in vitro. This model also distinguished active from weak/inactive promoters. Systematic examination of promoter strength as a function of RNA polymerase (RNAP) concentration revealed that UP-element contribution varied with RNAP availability and that the $\sigma$E regulon is comprised of two promoter types, one of which is active only at high concentrations of RNAP. Distinct promoter types may be a general mechanism for increasing the regulatory capacity of the ECF group of alternative $\sigma$'s. Our findings provide important insights into the sequence requirements for the strength and function of full-length promoters and establish guidelines for promoter prediction and for forward engineering promoters of specific strengths.},

abstract = {Background: Over the last few decades, computational genomics has tremendously contributed to decipher biology from genome sequences and related data. Considerable effort has been devoted to the prediction of transcription promoter and terminator sites that represent the essential "punctuation marks" for DNA transcription. Computational prediction of promoters in prokaryotes is a problem whose solution is far from being determined in computational genomics. The majority of published bacterial promoter prediction tools are based on a consensus-sequences search and they were designed specifically for vegetative $\sigma$70 promoters and, therefore, not suitable for promoter prediction in bacteria encoding a lot of $\sigma$ factors, like actinomycetes. Results: In this study we investigated the possibility to identify putative promoters in prokaryotes based on evolutionarily conserved motifs, and focused our attention on GC-rich bacteria in which promoter prediction with conventional, consensus-based algorithms is often not-exhaustive. Here, we introduce G4PromFinder, a novel algorithm that predicts putative promoters based on AT-rich elements and G-quadruplex DNA motifs. We tested its performances by using available genomic and transcriptomic data of the model microorganisms Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. We compared our results with those obtained by three currently available promoter predicting algorithms: the $\sigma$70consensus-based PePPER, the $\sigma$ factors consensus-based bTSSfinder, and PromPredict which is based on double-helix DNA stability. Our results demonstrated that G4PromFinder is more suitable than the three reference tools for both the genomes. In fact our algorithm achieved the higher accuracy (F1-scores 0.61 and 0.53 in the two genomes) as compared to the next best tool that is PromPredict (F1-scores 0.46 and 0.48). Consensus-based algorithms produced lower performances with the analyzed GC-rich genomes. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that G4PromFinder is a powerful tool for promoter search in GC-rich bacteria, especially for bacteria coding for a lot of $\sigma$ factors, such as the model microorganism S. coelicolor A3(2). Moreover consensus-based tools and, in general, tools that are based on specific features of bacterial $\sigma$ factors seem to be less performing for promoter prediction in these types of bacterial genomes.},

However, so far, design tools for codon optimisation have not been updated to reflect these new approaches. Approach: We designed an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to design coding sequences (CDSs) that encode a target protein for one or more target organisms, based on the Chimera average repetitive substring (ARS) metric -- a correlate of gene expression. A parameter scan was then used to find optimal parameter sets. Using the optimal parameter sets, three heterologous proteins were repeatedly optimised Bacillus subtilis 168 and Escherichia coli MG1655. The ARS scores of the resulting sequences were compared to the ARS scores of coding sequences that had been optimised for each organism individually (using Chimera Map). Results: We demonstrate that an EA is a valid approach to optimising a coding sequence for multiple organisms at once; both crossover and mutation operators were shown to be necessary for the best performance. In some scenarios, the EA generated CDSs that had higher ARS scores than CDSs optimised for the individual organisms, suggesting that the EA exploits the CDS design space in a way that Chimera Map does not. Availability and implementation: The implementation of the EA, with instructions, is available on GitHub: https://github.com/intbio-ncl/chimera{\_}evolve.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we analyse the sequence features influencing protein expression levels in 6,348 experiments using bacteriophage T7 polymerase to synthesize messenger RNA in Escherichia coli. Logistic regression yields a new codon-influence metric that correlates only weakly with genomic codon-usage frequency, but strongly with global physiological protein concentrations and also mRNA concentrations and lifetimes in vivo. Overall, the codon content influences protein expression more strongly than mRNA-folding parameters, although the latter dominate in the initial {\~{}}16 codons. Genes redesigned based on our analyses are transcribed with unaltered efficiency but translated with higher efficiency in vitro. The less efficiently translated native sequences show greatly reduced mRNA levels in vivo. Our results suggest that codon content modulates a kinetic competition between protein elongation and mRNA degradation that is a central feature of the physiology and also possibly the regulation of translation in E. coli.},

abstract = {Background
The prediction of the prokaryotic promoter strength based on its sequence is of great importance not only in the fundamental research of life sciences but also in the applied aspect of synthetic biology. Much advance has been made to build quantitative models for strength prediction, especially the introduction of machine learning methods such as artificial neural network (ANN) has significantly improve the prediction accuracy. As one of the most important machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) is more powerful to learn knowledge from small sample dataset and thus supposed to work in this problem.
Methods
To confirm this, we constructed SVM based models to quantitatively predict the promoter strength. A library of 100 promoter sequences and strength values was randomly divided into two datasets, including a training set (⩾10 sequences) for model training and a test set (⩾10 sequences) for model test.
Results
The results indicate that the prediction performance increases with an increase of the size of training set, and the best performance was achieved at the size of 90 sequences. After optimization of the model parameters, a high-performance model was finally trained, with a high squared correlation coefficient for fitting the training set (R2 {\textgreater} 0.99) and the test set (R2 {\textgreater} 0.98), both of which are better than that of ANN obtained by our previous work.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The use of predictive gene signatures to assist clinical decision is becoming more and more important. Deep learning has a huge potential in the prediction of phenotype from gene expression profiles. However, neural networks are viewed as black boxes, where accurate predictions are provided without any explanation. The requirements for these models to become interpretable are increasing, especially in the medical field. RESULTS We focus on explaining the predictions of a deep neural network model built from gene expression data. The most important neurons and genes influencing the predictions are identified and linked to biological knowledge. Our experiments on cancer prediction show that: (1) deep learning approach outperforms classical machine learning methods on large training sets; (2) our approach produces interpretations more coherent with biology than the state-of-the-art based approaches; (3) we can provide a comprehensive explanation of the predictions for biologists and physicians. CONCLUSION We propose an original approach for biological interpretation of deep learning models for phenotype prediction from gene expression data. Since the model can find relationships between the phenotype and gene expression, we may assume that there is a link between the identified genes and the phenotype. The interpretation can, therefore, lead to new biological hypotheses to be investigated by biologists.},

abstract = {Deep learning models can accurately map genomic DNA sequences to associated functional molecular readouts such as protein-DNA binding data. Base-resolution importance (i.e. "attribution") scores inferred from these models can highlight predictive sequence motifs and syntax. Unfortunately, these models are prone to overfitting and are sensitive to random initializations, often resulting in noisy and irreproducible attributions that obfuscate underlying motifs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel attribution prior, where the Fourier transform of input-level attribution scores are computed at training-time, and high-frequency components of the Fourier spectrum are penalized. We evaluate different model architectures with and without attribution priors trained on genome-wide binary or continuous molecular profiles. We show that our attribution prior dramatically improves models{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} stability, interpretability, and performance on held-out data, especially when training data is severely limited. Our attribution prior also allows models to identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs more sensitively and precisely within individual regulatory elements. The prior is agnostic to the model architecture or predicted experimental assay, yet provides similar gains across all experiments. This work represents an important advancement in improving the reliability of deep learning models for deciphering the regulatory code of the genome.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

A recurring theme in sigma factor control is their sequestration by anti-sigma factors that occlude their RNAP-binding determinants. Sigma factors are then released through a wide variety of mechanisms, often involving branched signal transduction pathways that allow the integration of distinct signals. Three major strategies for sigma release are discussed: regulated proteolysis, partner-switching, and direct sensing by the anti-sigma factor.},

abstract = {Background Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind to specific genomic sequences and affect numerous cellular processes. They regulate the rates of transcriptional activities of downstream genes through such binding events, thus acting as activators or repressors Abstract Background: Due to the complexity of the biological systems, the prediction of the potential DNA binding sites for transcription factors remains a difficult problem in computational biology. Genomic DNA sequences and experimental results from parallel sequencing provide available information about the affinity and accessibility of genome and are commonly used features in binding sites prediction. The attention mechanism in deep learning has shown its capability to learn long-range dependencies from sequential data, such as sentences and voices. Until now, no study has applied this approach in binding site inference from massively parallel sequencing data. The successful applications of attention mechanism in similar input contexts motivate us to build and test new methods that can accurately determine the binding sites of transcription factors. Results: In this study, we propose a novel tool (named DeepGRN) for transcription factors binding site prediction based on the combination of two components: single attention module and pairwise attention module. The performance of our methods is evaluated on the ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge datasets. The results show that DeepGRN achieves higher unified scores in 6 of 13 targets than any of the top four methods in the DREAM challenge. We also demonstrate that the attention weights learned by the model are correlated with potential informative inputs, such as DNase-Seq coverage and motifs, which provide possible explanations for the predictive improvements in DeepGRN. Conclusions: DeepGRN can automatically and effectively predict transcription factor binding sites from DNA sequences and DNase-Seq coverage. Furthermore, the visualization techniques we developed for the attention modules help to interpret how critical patterns from different types of input features are recognized by our model.},

It is largely unknown how such allocation arises from known mechanisms of gene regulation while constrained by limited translation capacity and fixed protein density. Here, we performed absolute transcriptomic and proteomic analysis for E. coli across many conditions, obtaining a plethora of results on promoters and mRNAs characteristics that clash with conventional expectations: the majority of mRNAs exhibit similar translational efficiencies, while the promoter strengths are vastly different across genes. These characteristics prescribe two principles of gene regulation guiding bacteria to attain the desired protein allocation under global constraints: Total transcriptional output is tightly coordinated with ribosomal activity, and the concentrations of individual proteins are largely set by transcription. These two principles lead to a quantitative formulation of Central Dogma which unravels the complex relationship between gene regulatory activities and mRNA/protein concentrations across conditions. The knowledge obtained will be invaluable for accurately inferring gene regulatory interactions from 'omics data, as well as for guiding the design of genetic circuits for synthetic biology applications in E. coli and other organisms.},

However, previous research mainly focused on the screening and characterization of some native promoters in Bacillus subtilis. To develop a broadly applicable promoter system for this important platform organism, we created a de novo synthetic promoter library (SPL) based on consensus sequences by analyzing the microarray transcriptome data of B. subtilis 168. A total of 214 potential promoters spanning a gradient of strengths was isolated and characterized by a green fluorescence assay. Among these, a detailed intensity analysis was conducted on nine promoters with different strengths by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Furthermore, reconstructed promoters and promoter cassettes (tandem promoter cluster) were designed via statistical model-based analysis and tandem dual promoters, which showed strength that was increased 1.2- and 2.77-fold compared to that of promoter P43, respectively. Finally, the SPL was employed in the production of inosine and acetoin by repressing and over-expressing the relevant metabolic pathways, yielding a 700{\%} and 44{\%} increase relative to the respective control strains. This is the first report of a de novo synthetic promoter library for B. subtilis, which is independent of any native promoter. The strategy of improving and fine-tuning promoter strengths will contribute to future metabolic engineering and synthetic biology projects in B. subtilis.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes{\~{}}(Kriging) are interpolating data-driven models that are frequently applied in various disciplines. Often, Gaussian processes are trained on datasets and are subsequently embedded as surrogate models in optimization problems. These optimization problems are nonconvex and global optimization is desired. However, previous literature observed computational burdens limiting deterministic global optimization to Gaussian processes trained on few data points. We propose a reduced-space formulation for deterministic global optimization with trained Gaussian processes embedded. For optimization, the branch-and-bound solver branches only on the degrees of freedom and McCormick relaxations are propagated through explicit Gaussian process models. The approach also leads to significantly smaller and computationally cheaper subproblems for lower and upper bounding. To further accelerate convergence, we derive envelopes of common covariance functions for GPs and tight relaxations of acquisition functions used in Bayesian optimization including expected improvement, probability of improvement, and lower confidence bound. In total, we reduce computational time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods, thus overcoming previous computational burdens. We demonstrate the performance and scaling of the proposed method and apply it to Bayesian optimization with global optimization of the acquisition function and chance-constrained programming.

Although studied extensively in single cells, it is still unclear how variation is controlled in multicellular organisms. Here, we used a machine-learning approach to identify genomic features that are predictive of genes with high versus low variation in their expression across individuals, using bulk data to remove stochastic cell-to-cell variation. Using embryonic gene expression across 75 Drosophila isogenic lines, we identify features predictive of expression variation (controlling for expression level), many of which are promoter-related. Genes with low variation fall into two classes reflecting different mechanisms to maintain robust expression, while genes with high variation seem to lack both types of stabilizing mechanisms. Applying this framework to humans revealed similar predictive features, indicating that promoter architecture is an ancient mechanism to control expression variation. Remarkably, expression variation features could also partially predict differential expression after diverse perturbations in both Drosophila and humans. Differential gene expression signatures may therefore be partially explained by genetically encoded gene-specific features, unrelated to the studied treatment.},

abstract = {Our ability to predict protein expression from DNA sequence alone remains poor, reflecting our limited understanding of cis-regulatory grammar and hampering the design of engineered genes for synthetic biology applications. Here, we generate a model that predicts the protein expression of the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a library of half a million 50-nucleotide-long random 5′ UTRs and assayed their activity in a massively parallel growth selection experiment. The resulting data allow us to quantify the impact on protein expression of Kozak sequence composition, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), and secondary structure. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the random library and showed that it performs well at predicting the protein expression of both a held-out set of the random 5′ UTRs as well as native S. cerevisiae 5′ UTRs. The model additionally was used to computationally evolve highly active 5′ UTRs. We confirmed experimentally that the great majority of the evolved sequences led to higher protein expression rates than the starting sequences, demonstrating the predictive power of this model.},

abstract = {Promoters are one of the most critical regulatory elements controlling metabolic pathways. However, in recent years, researchers have simply perfected promoter strength, but ignored the relationship between the internal sequences and promoter strength. In this context, we constructed and characterized a mutant promoter library of Ptrc through dozens of mutation-construction-screening-characterization engineering cycles. After excluding invalid mutation sites, we established a synthetic promoter library, which consisted of 3665 different variants, displaying an intensity range of more than two orders of magnitude. The strongest variant was 1.52-fold stronger than a 1 mM isopropyl-$\beta$-D-thiogalactoside driven PT7 promoter. Our synthetic promoter library exhibited superior applicability when expressing different reporters, in both plasmids and the genome. Different machine learning models were built and optimized to explore relationships between the promoter sequences and transcriptional strength. Finally, our XgBoost model exhibited optimal performance, and we utilized this approach to precisely predict the strength of artificially designed promoter sequences. Our work provides a powerful platform that enables the predictable tuning of promoters to achieve the optimal transcriptional strength.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Background Visualization tools for deep learning models typically focus on discovering key input features without considering how such low level features are combined in intermediate layers to make decisions. Moreover, many of these methods examine a network's response to specific input examples that may be insufficient to reveal the complexity of model decision making. Results We present DeepResolve, an analysis framework for deep convolutional models of genome function that visualizes how input features contribute individually and combinatorially to network decisions. Unlike other methods, DeepResolve does not depend upon the analysis of a predefined set of inputs. Rather, it uses gradient ascent to stochastically explore intermediate feature maps to 1) discover important features, 2) visualize their contribution and interaction patterns, and 3) analyze feature sharing across tasks that suggests shared biological mechanism. We demonstrate the visualization of decision making using our proposed method on deep neural networks trained on both experimental and synthetic data. DeepResolve is competitive with existing visualization tools in discovering key sequence features, and identifies certain negative features and non-additive feature interactions that are not easily observed with existing tools. It also recovers similarities between poorly correlated classes which are not observed by traditional methods. DeepResolve reveals that DeepSEA's learned decision structure is shared across genome annotations including histone marks, DNase hypersensitivity, and transcription factor binding. We identify groups of TFs that suggest known shared biological mechanism, and recover correlation between DNA hypersensitivities and TF/Chromatin marks. Conclusions DeepResolve is capable of visualizing complex feature contribution patterns and feature interactions that contribute to decision making in genomic deep convolutional networks. It also recovers feature sharing and class similarities which suggest interesting biological mechanisms. DeepResolve is compatible with existing visualization tools and provides complementary insights.},

abstract = {Long-range spatial interactions among genomic regions are critical for regulating gene expression and their disruption has been associated with a host of diseases. However, when modeling the effects of regulatory factors on gene expression, most deep learning models either neglect long-range interactions or fail to capture the inherent 3D structure of the underlying biological system. This prevents the field from obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of gene regulation and from fully leveraging the structural information present in the data sets. Here, we propose a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) framework to integrate measurements probing spatial genomic organization and measurements of local regulatory factors, specifically histone modifications, to predict gene expression. This formulation enables the model to incorporate crucial information about long-range interactions via a natural encoding of spatial interaction relationships into a graph representation. Furthermore, we show that our model is interpretable in terms of the observed biological regulatory factors, highlighting both the histone modifications and the interacting genomic regions that contribute to a gene's predicted expression. We apply our GCNN model to datasets for GM12878 (lymphoblastoid) and K562 (myelogenous leukemia) cell lines and demonstrate its state-of-the-art prediction performance. We also obtain importance scores corresponding to the histone mark features and interacting regions for some exemplar genes and validate them with evidence from the literature. Our model presents a novel setup for predicting gene expression by integrating multimodal datasets.},

abstract = {Strain engineering in biotechnology modifies metabolic pathways in microorganisms to overproduce target metabolites. To modify metabolic pathway activity in bacteria, gene expression is an effective and easy manipulated process, specifically the promoter sequence recognized by sigma factors. Promoter libraries are generated to scan the expression activity of different promoter sequences and to identify sequence positions that predict activity. To maximize information retrieval, a well-designed experimental setup is required. We present a computational workflow to analyse promoter libraries; by applying this workflow to seven libraries, we aim to identify critical design principles. The workflow is based on a Python Jupyter Notebook and covers the following steps: (i) statistical sequence analysis, (ii) sequence-input to expression-output predictions, (iii) estimator performance evaluation, and (iv) new sequence prediction with defined activity. The workflow can process multiple promoter libraries, across species or reporter proteins, and classify or regress expression activity. The strongest predictions in the sample libraries were achieved when the promoters in the library were recognized by a single sigma factor and a unique reporter system. A trade-off between sample size and sequence diversity reduces prediction quality, and we present a relationship to estimate the minimum sample size. The workflow guides the user through analysis and machine-learning training, is open source and easily adaptable to include alternative machine-learning strategies and to process sequence libraries from other expression-related problems. The workflow is a contribution to increase insight to the growing application of high-throughput experiments and provides support for efficient strain engineering. 2 1 Introduction Metabolic engineering aims at optimizing metabolite production by adjusting the activity of native and heterologous enzymes. A frequently manipulated factor of activity is the enzyme concentration which can be regulated on the transcriptional, translational and post-translational level. For each level, computational models were developed allowing realistic simulations and supporting rational adjustment. Models of  E transcription in E. coli were developed by Rhodius et al. (2010; 2012) and allow analysis of the effects of upstream regulating elements and core promoter. Translational components affect enzyme concentration via ribosome binding site, codon usage and mRNA stability. The effect of the ribosome binding site depends on the homology of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and mRNA secondary structures and for E. coli a predictive model was published (Salis et al., 2009) and recently integrated with a resource allocation model (N{\'{o}}bel and Pic{\'{o}}, 2020). The codon usage, mRNA stability and enzyme concentration are correlated and jointly determine enzyme concentration in E. coli (Kudla et al., 2009; Boel et al., 2016), and a predictive model of mRNA stability was published by Cetnar {\&} Salis (2020). Finally, protein stability determines concentration and a review of predictive models is given by Fang (2020). Although the models have reported high correlation between prediction and experiment, the massive evaluation of 244.000 sequences for translational effects during   expression in E. coli achieved lower correlation (Cambray et al., 2018). In conclusion, the relative impact of expression factors is hard to estimate on the genome level.},

abstract = {Accurate computational identification of promoters remains a challenge as these key DNA regulatory regions have variable structures composed of functional motifs that provide gene-specific initiation of transcription. In this paper we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze sequence characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters and build their predictive models. We trained a similar CNN architecture on promoters of five distant organisms: human, mouse, plant (Arabidopsis), and two bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis). We found that CNN trained on sigma70 subclass of Escherichia coli promoter gives an excellent classification of promoters and non-promoter sequences (Sn = 0.90, Sp = 0.96, CC = 0.84). The Bacillus subtilis promoters identification CNN model achieves Sn = 0.91, Sp = 0.95, and CC = 0.86. For human, mouse and Arabidopsis promoters we employed CNNs for identification of two well-known promoter classes (TATA and non-TATA promoters). CNN models nicely recognize these complex functional regions. For human promoters Sn/Sp/CC accuracy of prediction reached 0.95/0.98/0,90 on TATA and 0.90/0.98/0.89 for non-TATA promoter sequences, respectively. For Arabidopsis we observed Sn/Sp/CC 0.95/0.97/0.91 (TATA) and 0.94/0.94/0.86 (non-TATA) promoters. Thus, the developed CNN models, implemented in CNNProm program, demonstrated the ability of deep learning approach to grasp complex promoter sequence characteristics and achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the previously developed promoter prediction programs. We also propose random substitution procedure to discover positionally conserved promoter functional elements. As the suggested approach does not require knowledge of any specific promoter features, it can be easily extended to identify promoters and other complex functional regions in sequences of many other and especially newly sequenced genomes. The CNNProm program is available to run at web server http://www.softberry.com.},

Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed-forward neural networks.},

abstract = {Sequenced bacterial genomes provide a wealth of information but little understanding of transcriptional regulatory circuits largely because accurate prediction of promoters is difficult. We examined two important issues for accurate promoter prediction: (1) the ability to predict promoter strength and (2) the sequence properties that distinguish between active and weak/inactive promoters. We addressed promoter prediction using natural core promoters recognized by the well-studied alternative sigma factor, Escherichia coli $\sigma$E, as a representative of group 4 $\sigma$s, the largest $\sigma$ group. To evaluate the contribution of sequence to promoter strength and function, we used modular position weight matrix models comprised of each promoter motif and a penalty score for suboptimal motif location. We find that a combination of select modules is moderately predictive of promoter strength and that imposing minimal motif scores distinguished active from weak/inactive promoters. The combined -35/-10 score is the most important predictor of activity. Our models also identified key sequence features associated with active promoters. A conserved “AAC” motif in the -35 region is likely to be a general predictor of function for promoters recognized by group 4 $\sigma$s. These results provide valuable insights into sequences that govern promoter strength, distinguish active and inactive promoters for the first time, and are applicable to both in vivo and in vitro measures of promoter strength.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in high-throughput combinatorial mutagenesis assays, the number of labeled sequences available to predict molecular functions has remained small for the vastness of the sequence space combined with the ruggedness of many fitness functions. Expressive models in machine learning (ML), such as deep neural networks (DNNs), can model the nonlinearities in rugged fitness functions, which manifest as high-order epistatic interactions among the mutational sites. However, in the absence of an inductive bias, DNNs overfit to the small number of labeled sequences available for training. Herein, we exploit the recent biological evidence that epistatic interactions in many fitness functions are sparse; this knowledge can be used as an inductive bias to regularize DNNs. We have developed a method for sparse epistatic regularization of DNNs, called the epistatic net (EN), which constrains the number of non-zero coefficients in the spectral representation of DNNs. For larger sequences, where finding the spectral transform becomes computationally intractable, we have developed a scalable extension of EN, which subsamples the combinatorial sequence space uniformly inducing a sparse-graph-code structure, and regularizes DNNs using the resulting greedy optimization method. Results on several biological landscapes, from bacterial to protein fitness functions, show that EN consistently improves the prediction accuracy of DNNs and enables them to outperform competing models which assume other forms of inductive biases. EN estimates all the higher-order epistatic interactions of DNNs trained on massive sequence spaces-a computational problem that takes years to solve without leveraging the epistatic sparsity in the fitness functions.},

In principle, the expression of any given gene can be modulated in a quasi-continuum of discrete expression levels but the traditional approaches are usually limited to two extremes: gene knockout and strong overexpression. However, applications such as metabolic optimization and control analysis necessitate a continuous set of expression levels with only slight increments in strength to cover a specific window around the wild-type expression level of the studied gene; this requirement can be met by using promoter libraries. This approach generally consists of inserting a library of promoters in front of the gene to be studied, whereby the individual promoters might deviate either in their spacer sequences or bear slight deviations from the consensus sequence of a vegetative promoter.

Notably, we observed differences regarding codon usage patterns between genes coding for highly abundant proteins and genes coding for less abundant proteins. Analysis of synonymous codon usage and evolutionary selection showed a clear split between the two groups. Our machine learning models predicted protein abundances from codon usage metrics with remarkable accuracy, achieving R² values higher than previously reported in the literature.

abstract = {Promoters play an essential role in the regulation of gene expression for fine-tuning genetic circuits and metabolic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). However, native promoters in S. cerevisiae have several limitations which hinder their applications in metabolic engineering. These limitations include an inadequate number of well-characterized promoters, poor dynamic range, and insufficient orthogonality to endogenous regulations. Therefore, it is necessary to perform promoter engineering to create synthetic promoters with better properties. Here, we review recent advances related to promoter architecture, promoter engineering and synthetic promoter applications in S. cerevisiae. We also provide a perspective of future directions in this field with an emphasis on the recent advances of machine learning based promoter designs.},

abstract = {Background The enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) play a critical role in gene regulation in eukaryotes. In genetics, a promoter is a region of DNA sequence upstream of a particular gene [1]. The length of a promoter is probably hundreds to thousands of base pairs [2]. Abstract Background: Enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) play key roles in transcriptional regulation and disease progression. Although several computational methods have been developed to predict such interactions, their performances are not satisfactory when training and testing data from different cell lines. Currently, it is still unclear what extent a across cell line prediction can be made based on sequence-level information. Results: In this work, we present a novel Sequence-based method (called SEPT) to predict the enhancer-promoter interactions in new cell line by using the cross-cell information and Transfer learning. SEPT first learns the features of enhancer and promoter from DNA sequences with convolutional neural network (CNN), then designing the gradient reversal layer of transfer learning to reduce the cell line specific features meanwhile retaining the features associated with EPIs. When the locations of enhanc-ers and promoters are provided in new cell line, SEPT can successfully recognize EPIs in this new cell line based on labeled data of other cell lines. The experiment results show that SEPT can effectively learn the latent import EPIs-related features between cell lines and achieves the best prediction performance in terms of AUC (the area under the receiver operating curves). Conclusions: SEPT is an effective method for predicting the EPIs in new cell line. Domain adversarial architecture of transfer learning used in SEPT can learn the latent EPIs shared features among cell lines from all other existing labeled data. It can be expected that SEPT will be of interest to researchers concerned with biological interaction prediction.},

abstract = {Understanding the composability of genetic elements is central to synthetic biology. Even for seemingly well-known elements such as a sigma 70 promoter the genetic context-dependent variability of promoter activity remains poorly understood. The lack of understanding of sequence to function results in highly limited de novo design of novel genetic element combinations. To address this issue, we characterized in detail concatenated “stacked” synthetic promoters including varying spacer sequence lengths and compared the transcription strength to the output of the individual promoters. The proxy for promoter activity, the msfGFP synthesis from stacked promoters was consistently lower than expected from the sum of the activities of the single promoters. While the spacer sequence itself had no activity, it drastically affected promoter activities when placed up- or downstream of a promoter. Single promoter-spacer combinations revealed a bivalent effect on msfGFP synthesis. By systematic analysis of promoter and spacer combinations, a semi-empirical correlation was developed to determine the combined activity of stacked promoters.},

abstract = {Design of synthetic genetic circuits without considering the impact of host-circuit interactions results in an inefficient design process and lengthy trial-and-error iterations to appropriately tune the expression levels. Microorganisms have evolved to reach an optimal use of cellular resources. This balance is perturbed by circuit-host interactions resulting from the interaction among the cell environment from which the cell takes substrates, its metabolism, and the needs of exogenous synthetic genetic circuit introduced in the cell host. The resulting competition for common shared cell resources introduces spurious dynamics leading to problems of malfunctioning of the synthetic circuit due to lack of enough cellular resources. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in development of methods for model-based design of synthetic gene circuits considering host-circuit interactions. Here we present a small-size model of gene expression dynamics in bacterial cells accounting for host-circuit interactions. For each gene, the model defines the cellular resources recruitment strength as the key functional coefficient that allows to explain the distribution of resources among the host and the genes of interest and the relationship between the usage of resources and cell growth. This functional coefficient explicitly takes into account the availability of resources and lab-accessible gene characteristics, such as promoter and ribosome binding site (RBS) strengths and capture their interplay with the availability of free cell resources. In spite of its simplicity, the model is able to explain the differential role of promoter and RBS strengths in the distribution of protein mass and the optimal protein expression productivity with remarkable fit to the experimental data from the literature for E. coli. This makes the model amenable for model-based circuit design purposes. Moreover, the model also allows to understand why endogenous ribosomal and non-ribosomal genes have evolved different strategies in the expression space.},

abstract = {It is known that cis-acting DNA motifs play an important role in regulating gene expression. The genome in a cell thus contains the information that not only encodes for the synthesis of proteins but also is necessary for regulating expression of genes. Therefore, the mRNA level of a gene may be predictable from the DNA sequence. Indeed, three deep neural network models were developed recently to predict the mRNA level of a gene directly or indirectly from the DNA sequence around the transcription start side of the gene. In this work, we develop a deep residual network model, named ExpResNet, to predict gene expression directly from DNA sequence. Applying ExpResNet to the GTEx data, we demonstrate that ExpResNet outperforms the three existing models across four tissues tested. Our model may be useful in the investigation of gene regulation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
